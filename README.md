## 1. Initial Work

The first thing I did was take notes during our instructors demo of some of the material we could use in our homework assignment. After that, I tested some JS a classmate had tried to use to get his project working. He was very clear it didn't work, but it was a starting place. I then read through the README given to us by Trilology and pseudocoded my JS with what I thought would need to be done.

The next thing I did was connect my HTML with the CSS style sheet provided by Trilology. This would give me a better understanding of where things were and how to connect them. Once that was done I went back and reviewed the classes that demo'd this homewore assignment.
