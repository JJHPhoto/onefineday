## 1. My Workflow

The first thing I did was take notes during our instructors demo of some of the material we could use in our homework assignment. After that, I tested some JS a classmate had tried to use to get his project working. He was very clear it didn't work, but it was a starting place. I then read through the README given to us by Trilology and pseudocoded my JS with what I thought would need to be done.

The next thing I did was connect my HTML with the CSS style sheet provided by Trilology. This would give me a better understanding of where things were and how to connect them. Once that was done I went back and reviewed the classes that demo'd this homework assignment. At the advice from my study group, I also went back and reviewed class activities that did similar things in code. I'd plug in that code and modify it to fit my project.

After that, I also looked up a few things online that were more specific to what I wanted to do. Maybe I'm getting better at Google, but I was able to find some very good code online that was similiar enough to my work that I could modify it to work for me.

At this point, I was happy to take on the most difficult part: local storage.
